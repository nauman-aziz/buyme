git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- JavaScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Stripe
- Next js
- Prisma
- seeding
- db migration

## ðŸ§© How They All Work Together

Docker gives you Postgres running locally.

Prisma schema defines models (User, Product, Faq).

Migrations apply schema changes to the database.

Seeding fills the DB with test/demo data.

Frontend (Next.js) can now fetch data via APIs that talk to Prisma, which talks to Postgres.

So when you ran all those commands, you basically:

Brought up a database (docker compose up).

Told Prisma to sync schema with DB (prisma migrate dev).

Inserted starter data (npm run db:seed).

To get started:

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup database with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# TO check if docker is up
docker exec -e PGPASSWORD=postgres -it gearhub-postgres psql -U postgres -d gearhub -c "select 'connected' as status;"

# Run migrations and seed data
npx prisma generate 
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# Start development
npm run dev
Test accounts:

Admin: admin@demo.dev / Admin123!
Customer: customer@demo.dev / Customer123!
